# ADR 0012 — JIT Feature Completion: IC + GC Integration

> Status: **Proposed** for M6 Phase 5 (after Phase 4 iter BC).
> Supersedes nothing; ratifies and operationalizes ADR 0011 D-4
> (inline caches — shape unspecified) and ADR 0006 (precise rooting,
> still in force).
> Companion research:
> - `/tmp/jit_research_ic.md` — inline cache survey + design
> - `/tmp/jit_research_gc.md` — JIT-GC integration survey + design

## Context

At commit `859896a` (M6 Phase 4 iter BC), the JIT covers a usable
slice of Scheme but two architectural holes block the rest:

1. **No general Call.** Bodies that call any non-self closure refuse
   to JIT. Only `Inst::CallSelf` and inline-specialized builtins are
   wired. This is the single biggest unlock.
2. **Bypassing the GC.** `Inst::Cons` allocates `Box<Value>` via
   `Box::into_raw`. The mark-sweep `cs-gc` never sees these boxes.
   `Inst::AnyClone` / `Inst::AnyDrop` bandaid the lifetime through
   linear typing but fragility under joins, loops, and recursive
   Any-arg calls is documented and growing.

Both holes are well-studied in production JITs. Two research agents
surveyed the landscape; this ADR records the decisions, the rationale,
and the iter sequence that delivers them.

## Decisions

### D-1 — Inline cache shape

**Per-call-site monomorphic-first IC stored in a side table owned by
the JIT module**, addressed by a pointer baked into the compiled body
as a constant.

| Knob              | Choice                                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Slot location     | Side table `Box<[IcSlot]>` in `Lowerer`       |
| Slot addressing   | Pointer constant baked into JIT body          |
| Cache key         | `u32` stable closure id (`ClosureId`)         |
| Cache value       | `(jit_ptr, arity, param_types: u32)`          |
| Polymorphism cap  | `MAX_POLY = 4`, then megamorphic              |
| Miss path         | Runtime helper → fall back to `vm_call_sync`  |
| Invalidation      | Generation counter; bumped on JIT recompile   |

**Why per-call-site:** the literature (Hölzle/Chambers/Ungar ECOOP
1991; V8, JSC, SpiderMonkey all production) is universal — call-site
locality dominates closure locality. Per-closure caching forgets
which site is calling, conflating sites that alternate vs sites that
stabilize.

**Why side table over self-modifying code:** Cranelift doesn't
expose runtime patching naturally. V8's FeedbackVector + SpiderMonkey
CacheIR both use side tables; the empirical cost is one extra load,
well below the dispatch-stub-jump cost SMC saves. Our deopt model
(today's `clear_jit_for_recompile` at cs-vm/src/vm.rs) already
assumes pointer-address stability, so this also stays coherent.

**Why `u32` ClosureId over raw `*const VmClosure`:** stable across
GC, cheap to compare, cleared on drop without dangling. Registry is a
`Vec<Weak<VmClosure>>` walked at GC checkpoints. Symbol-based keys
break under redefinition; lambda-idx + env hash is too slow on hot.

### D-2 — GC integration strategy

**Adopt Cranelift's user-stack-maps API** (`declare_value_needs_stack_map`,
`UserStackMap`) and **lift the JIT's allocation contract from
`Box::into_raw(Box<Value>)` to a raw-handle form of `Gc<Value>`.**

| Knob                  | Choice                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Root tracking         | Cranelift user stack maps (precise)            |
| ABI carrier           | `Gc<Value>` raw handle (vs current `Box<Value>`) |
| Helper rename         | `vm_alloc_pair` → `vm_alloc_pair_gc`, etc.     |
| Reference protocol    | refcount via `Rc::increment_strong_count`      |
| New tag               | `JIT_RT_GC` — replaces `JIT_RT_ANY` semantics  |
| Frame walking         | FP-chain on x86_64 + aarch64 (unwind_info on)  |
| Migration             | Box helpers stay one iter for A/B safety       |

**Why precise stack maps over conservative scanning:** WASM target
(M10) forbids conservative scanning; ADR 0006 already commits to
precise rooting; Cranelift now offers exactly the API we need
(`UserStackMap` with `(ir::Type, SP-offset)` entries — Fitzgen, "New
Stack Maps for Wasmtime and Cranelift", 2024-09).

**Why `Gc<Value>` over keeping `Box<Value>` + side-mark:** the boxes
hold `Gc<Pair>` etc. internally, so we already pay one indirection;
hoisting the JIT carrier to `Gc<Value>` eliminates the Box layer
entirely and lets the GC trace through `Value::Pair(gc)` naturally
without a separate registry. Refcount via `Rc::increment_strong_count`
is what `AnyClone` already approximates — formalize it.

**Why not refcount-only (current):** cycles leak, AnyClone fragility,
no path to MMTk arena (Phase 2 of GC).

### D-3 — Ordering & layering

GC integration ships **before** the IC. Two reasons:

1. The IC slot contents (jit_ptr) need a stable lifetime. Today's
   `clear_jit_for_recompile` invalidates by pointer — the IC will
   too. The GC migration also reaches into `VmClosure` lifecycle, so
   doing it second creates merge churn against the IC's call-site
   tables.
2. AnyClone/AnyDrop fragility is currently *gated* by linear-typing
   discipline in the translator — adding general Call multiplies the
   non-linear cases (a callee's arg is the same Any value being held
   by the caller's continuation). Land GC first, then the IC inherits
   precise rooting for free.

## Non-decisions / deferred

- **MMTk integration.** ADR 0006 leaves the door open for MMTk; this
  ADR opts to use Cranelift stack maps with the existing mark-sweep
  `cs-gc` first. MMTk is a Phase 2 conversion.
- **Polymorphic chain implementation.** Recommendation is a linked
  list of `IcSlot` (V8/JSC style) but the data structure can be
  flat-array if profiling shows ≤ 4 entries dominates. Defer until iters
  BG-BH show empirical hit rate distributions.
- **Lambda creation in JIT bodies.** Needed for `(lambda (x) ...)`
  inside hot code; out of scope for this ADR. Comes after IC lands.

## Iter sequence

Eight iters across two milestones. Names continue M6 Phase 4's
convention (BD onward; BB and BC are committed).

### Phase 4 closeout — GC integration (BD–BG)

| Iter | Deliverable                                               | Risk   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| BD   | Reserve `JIT_RT_GC = 0x10`; add `Gc::{into,from}_raw_jit` | Low    |
| BE   | `JitStackMaps` registry; `scan_frame`; FP-chain walker    | Medium |
| BF   | `Cons` lowered via `*_gc` helpers + stack-map plumbing    | High   |
| BG   | Extend `Car`/`Cdr`/`PairP`/`NullP`; retire `AnyClone`/`AnyDrop` for Gc slots | High |

After BG, `Inst::AnyClone`/`AnyDrop` stay only on the i64-tagged
immediate decoy path (currently unreachable post-BG). Mark them
deprecated; remove in a later cleanup.

### Phase 5 — Inline cache (BH–BL)

| Iter | Deliverable                                               | Risk   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| BH   | `ClosureId` registry; `IcSlot` struct; reserve side table | Low    |
| BI   | Lowered call sequence (load-compare-call); helper miss path | High |
| BJ   | First end-to-end JIT'd non-self call (warmup test)         | High   |
| BK   | Polymorphic chain (2–4 entries); promotion at `miss_count > 16` | Medium |
| BL   | Megamorphic + invalidation + scoreboard (perf telemetry)   | Medium |

## Risks & mitigations

- **Cranelift stack maps are new (2024-09).** Mitigate by gating the
  `*_gc` path behind a runtime flag for one iter (BF); A/B against
  the existing 39-test M6 Phase 4 suite before flipping the default.
- **FP-chain walking is platform-specific.** x86_64 + aarch64
  validated; gate via `cfg(any(target_arch = "x86_64", target_arch
  = "aarch64"))`; fall back to today's path otherwise.
- **IC + GC interaction.** ClosureId registry holds `Weak<VmClosure>`;
  GC visits each on `collect()` and clears IC slots whose id is
  unreachable. Tested via a closure-redefinition stress test in BL.
- **Deopt path must read spill slots as `Gc<Value>`, not `Box<Value>`.**
  The dispatcher tier-down at the sentinel reads the IC slot using
  `ManuallyDrop<Gc<Value>>` to avoid double-free. Covered by the BG
  differential test.
